## Clothing Shops in Salzburg – Interactive Map

This web-based project visualizes clothing shop locations across Salzburg, Austria, using Leaflet.js and GeoJSON data. The map includes interactive features such as popups, search functionality, hover effects, and a layer control for enhanced user experience.

---

## Target User

The project is aimed at:
- *Tourists* visiting Salzburg who want to discover fashion stores;
- *Local shoppers* searching for specific clothing or sports shops;
- *Urban planners or students* interested in spatial distribution of commerce in the city.

---

## Data Source

- The dataset clothshops.geojson contains a collection of point features representing clothing shop locations in Salzburg.
- Attributes include:
  - name: Shop name


---

## Methodology

- *Map Library:* [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) for rendering interactive maps.
- *Base map:* OpenStreetMap (default) and OpenTopoMap (satellite-like alternative).
- *Custom Markers:* Circle markers and custom icons to distinguish shops.
- *Interactivity:*
  - Hover highlights and animations;
  - Search by shop name;

---

## Design Choices

- *Color scheme:* Orange markers for default shops; yellow for highlighted.
- *UI/UX:* Minimalistic and functional — focused on quick interaction and easy visual feedback.
- *Responsive interaction:* Smooth zoom, search, hover animation, and popup logic.
- *Accessibility:* Simple, clear UI without complex overlays.

## Analysis

- The distribution of shops is mostly concentrated in central Salzburg (around Getreidegasse and Linzer Gasse).
- Interactive filtering (e.g. between clothing and sports shops) enables quick insights into commercial zoning.
- The map encourages spatial exploration and supports decision-making for visitors.

---

## Potential Improvements

- Add category filtering UI (checkboxes or dropdown).
- Add walking routes between shops using polyline features.
- Implement clustering for better performance at larger scales.
- Support for multi-language (English + German).
- Add analytics (e.g., most clicked shop, search terms).
 - Popups with details;
  - Fly-to animation on click;
  - Double-click coordinates display;
  - Search by shop name;
  - Legend for marker colors;
  - Layer control for toggling shop types (clothing vs sports).
- Attributes include:
  - address: Shop address (optional)
  - hours: Opening hours (optional)
  - type: (optional) for filtering shop types, e.g. "clothing", "sports"

## Critical Reflection

Working on this project improved my understanding of:
- Leaflet fundamentals and plugin usage;
- GeoJSON structuring and parsing;
- JavaScript DOM interaction;
- Map UI/UX principles;
- Debugging fetch and JSON errors.

Challenge is managing multiple layers and avoiding duplicated data — especially when loading and styling GeoJSON features multiple times. I also learned to structure map logic modularly (steps 1 to 8).

## Key Takeaways

- Small datasets can become powerful when presented interactively.
- User experience depends heavily on smooth interactivity and visual clarity.
- Leaflet is a lightweight but powerful tool for geospatial web applications.
